        <p>In 2010, GitHub was hosting 1 million repositories.[23]
            A year later, this number doubled.[24] ReadWriteWeb
            reported that GitHub had surpassed SourceForge and
            Google Code in total number of commits for the period of
            January to May 2011.[25] On &lt;p&gt; January 16, 2013,
            GitHub passed the 3 million users mark and was then
            hosting more
